Version 0.5.0
  * Kiji Hive Adapter now supports writing of primitive types.  Any tables that already exist in the Hive metastore need to be recreated in order to take advantage of the new classes.

Version 0.4.1
  * KIJIHIVE-26. Default to HBaseRowKey when EntityId components aren't present.

Version 0.4.0
  * KIJIHIVE-23. Updates to Kiji Hive Adapter to become compatible with 
      KijiSchema 1.1.x.
      - Kiji Hive Adapter now uses Hive 0.11, which is included in CDH 4.2.1.
      - Refactored Kiji Hive Adapter to use Hadoop Writable objects internally
        for transferring data around within Hive, this eliminates the need to
        track the schema table for decoding of HBaseResults in evaluation.

Version 0.3.0
  * KIJIHIVE-19. Allow ability to read entity ids up through to Hive. 
      Thanks Jeff!

      nullable fields within complex types.
